# shell

A nice way to write shell in C language that run under UNIX (centos 7).
Similar to the original shell, but in addition support commands that related to restaurant,
such as create menu, get specific dish price from specific restaurant, make order and etc.
The correctness of the commands can be assumed.

**Does not support pipe commands
